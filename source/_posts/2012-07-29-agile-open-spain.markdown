On Saturday the 23rd, me, {% twitter jordimash %}, and {% twitter jdiazch %} went to [Agile Open Spain 2012](http://aos2012.wordpress.com/) in Zaragoza. We attended the following [sessions](http://kit-aos.appspot.com):

* Kaizen and Kaikaku
* User Experience + User Stories
* Inception Desk
* Code smell y deuda t√©cnica
* Mejora continua

## Talks
### Kaizen and Kaikaku
Kaizen and Kaikaku are two different approaches to Scrum. Kaizen means a continuous change towards Scrum, while Kaikaku is a disruptive switch to Scrum.

The presenter talked about the topic of "useful utopia", in which rather than trying to immediately reach utopia, a team instead makes a continuous move towards it.

We also discussed the difficulty of taking the Kaikaku approach without using a top down approach. Almost everyone was in agreement that to take that approach, it would be necessary to have an edict handed out from the heads of the company.

### User Experience + User Stories
In this talk the presenters ({% twitter ujue %} and {% twitter jmbeas %}) talked about their experience working with developers on user stories and user experience. She talked about how UX specialists integrated with the team: one UX specialist integrated with a different team, and in that way they learned a lot about of the team, and the team learned about how UX works.

UX is a shared responsibility:

* The UX team participates in the retrospectives.
* Developers are responsible for UX; if they don't know what to do they should work with the UX team.
* Developers should raise concerns with UX team.

For reading resources, the presenters suggested [UX Magazine](http://uxmag.com/).

### Inception Desk
This was a talk about the [Inception Deck](http://agilewarrior.wordpress.com/2010/11/06/the-agile-inception-deck/), ten questions to ask yourself and your client before starting your next project. This originates from the book [Agile Samurai](http://pragprog.com/book/jtrap/the-agile-samurai).

The presenter mentioned that because it can be difficult to get clients to sit down with them for four to five hours at a time to answer these questions, her team would bring suggestions for questions so that the client just had to fill in or make modifications to the suggestions.

Suggestions / tips:

* Split the Inception process into two different sessions to give the team time to think about the project in between sessions.
* Each person writes an objective for the session in a piece of paper and hands that paper to someone else. This serves as an ice breaker and also forces the participants to think of different points of view.
* Create a clock where each hour is a step of the process, and as you go through it move the hands in the clock.
* Create stereotypes to identify behaviors that affect the use of the product. Everyone comes up with this list.
* Create an effect map identifying who will help you reach your objective and how they will do that.

### Code smell y deuda tecnica
This talk was given by the folks at [Programando en .NET](http://www.programandonet.com/site).

This talk was about how to identify technical debt, and it inspired a discussion between those who thought that technical debt was necessity sometimes and those who thought it was never acceptable to introduce technical debt.

Code smells indicators:

1. Rigidity
2. Fragility
3. Immobility
4. Viscosity. i.e. slow build times, slow development, too many interfaces.
5. Unnecessary complexity.
6. Copy and paste
7. Opacity/readability

We also discussed who should take responsibility for technical debt. A participant suggested that if the company makes the choice to use hacks to get the product delivered more quickly, it's their responsibility and the code should bear their seal. However, everyone was in agreement that professional standards dictate that developers should do their best to avoid technical debt.

The topic of TODOs was interesting because it hits close to home. Someone asked about how to deal with TODOs, and the response was simple: they shouldn't exist. {% twitter @jordimas %} chimed in that TODOs should be captured as tickets to give visibility during backlog prioritization.

How to deal with technical debt:

1. Prevent it.
2. Treat it by refactoring the code.

Many participants discussed how to communicate to clients and bosses that time was needed to refactor code. Someone suggested that you couldn't just go up to client and tell them that you needed time to fix things you did incorrectly, even though this does happen even when you do your best to avoid technical debt. My favorite suggestion was to tell the client that more time was needed to improve the quality of the code. My own approach is to include the time for refactoring in the estimates for completion.

### Mejora continua
This was one of the more interesting talks and it was a pity that we had to leave halfway through to catch the train back to Barcelona. The topic was things that people did at their companies or groups to continuously improve the software development process and their team.

The items that people shared were not limited only to technical approaches such as code reviews, but also social stuff like a weekly hour on Friday at the end of the day for everyone on the company from different teams to get together, in order to get people from different departments to know each other.

Suggestions:

* Pair programming
* Tech talks
* Code reviews

We also talked about the three factors necessary for an employee to feel engaged in their work:

* Autonomy
* Mastery
* Purpose

## Overall impression
The organization of each talk was novel to me, as this is the first time I attended an event organized by the Agile community in Spain. Most of the talks involved the participants sitting in a circle rather than sitting on the available chairs in the room, and I think this allowed a more informal style of collaboration and encouraged the participants to be more open.
